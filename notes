Parts:

- Publisher
- SCM

Workflow:
- Publisher:
  - retention:
     - after having archived and added an action to build etc
     - Check retention policy for project
     - If retention policy is anything but "keep everything", apply it.

  - config:
    - Retain:
      - For all builds
      - For most recent completed build (with threshold options for successful, >=unstable, >=failed as well)
      - For X most recent builds
      - For X most recent completed build (w/ threshold)

- SCM:
  - polling:
      - Retain build number of previous parent build for comparison
      - Go to parent project
      - Get most recent completed build
        - Check for archive action
        - If archive action found and current build is > previous parent build, polling returns true.
        - If no archive action is found and current build is > previous parent build, recurse on next most recent completed build.
        - else return false
  - Config options:
     - Parent project (from list of projects with publisher enabled)
  - getLastCompletedBuild for parent project - how do you verify that it has the archive? Ah-ha - an action! now to understand how actions work...
  - to get changeset -
    - Copy changelog.xml from original build
    - createChangeLogParser() returns parentProject.getSCM().createChangeLogParser() and tada!
